# Kernels on fuzzy sets library

## Synopsis
This project contains implementations of kernels on fuzzy sets. 
We will include examples of the use of those kernels in the folowing domains:
* similarity measure between fuzzy sets. A possible example will be to measure similarity across subjective opinions, beliefs/uncertanty represented by linguistic values, etc
* similarity between regions in image processing
* estimation of distances (metrics) between fuzzy sets
* fuzzy data analytics (statistics from fuzzy data using kernels)
* fuzzification of datasets
* computation of kernel gram matrices from fuzzy data
* data description of fuzzy data (minimum volume sets, density estimation, one-class classification, etc)
* predictive modeling (machine learning) of fuzzy data (classification, regression, ranking, etc) 
* integration with scikit-learn
